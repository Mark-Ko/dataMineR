Binning and recode `r var_names[i]`
-----------------------

Here we wil look for optimal binnning of each variable and scale the variable to uniform scale.

```{r}
read_chunk("data-preperation.R")
```

```{r recode}

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```
